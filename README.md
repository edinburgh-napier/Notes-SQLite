# Notes with SQLite

This is an example .NERT MAUI application that uses the MVVM pattern and SQLite for local storage.

It builds on the Microsoft [notes app tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/tutorials/notes-app/) 
which is upgraded in the follow-on [MVVM tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/tutorials/notes-mvvm/).

This version uses SQLite for data storage rather than storing notesin individual text files.
